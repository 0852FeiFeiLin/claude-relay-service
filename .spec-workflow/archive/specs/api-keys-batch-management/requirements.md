# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature introduces comprehensive batch management capabilities for API Keys in the Claude Relay Service, enabling administrators to efficiently manage multiple API keys through batch operations including tag management, account assignment, and status control. The feature builds upon the existing API key infrastructure and extends the current batch delete functionality to provide a complete management solution.

The batch management feature addresses the operational challenges of managing large numbers of API keys by providing intuitive multi-select interfaces and batch operations that reduce administrative overhead while maintaining security and audit capabilities.

## Alignment with Product Vision

This feature aligns with the Claude Relay Service's goal of providing enterprise-grade API management capabilities by:
- Enhancing operational efficiency through batch operations
- Providing granular control over API key organization and access
- Maintaining comprehensive audit trails for security compliance
- Supporting scalable multi-tenant API key management

## Requirements

### Requirement 1 - Batch Tag Management

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to apply tags to multiple API keys simultaneously, so that I can efficiently organize and categorize large numbers of keys for better management and filtering.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator selects multiple API keys THEN the system SHALL display a batch tag management interface
2. WHEN batch tag operation is initiated THEN the system SHALL show existing tags on selected keys AND allow adding new tags
3. WHEN applying tags to multiple keys THEN the system SHALL preserve existing tags unless explicitly removed
4. WHEN tag operation completes THEN the system SHALL log the change AND update all affected keys atomically
5. IF tag operation fails partially THEN the system SHALL rollback all changes AND report specific failures

### Requirement 2 - Batch Account Assignment

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to assign specific accounts (Claude, Gemini, OpenAI, Bedrock) to multiple API keys at once, so that I can efficiently configure key routing and access permissions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN administrator selects multiple API keys THEN the system SHALL provide batch account assignment interface
2. WHEN assigning accounts THEN the system SHALL display current account assignments for selected keys
3. WHEN account assignment is applied THEN the system SHALL update claudeAccountId, geminiAccountId, openaiAccountId, and bedrockAccountId fields
4. WHEN conflicting account assignments exist THEN the system SHALL warn administrator AND require confirmation
5. IF account assignment fails THEN the system SHALL maintain existing assignments AND log the error

### Requirement 3 - Batch Status Management

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to enable or disable multiple API keys simultaneously, so that I can quickly respond to security incidents or operational requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN administrator selects multiple API keys THEN the system SHALL provide batch enable/disable options
2. WHEN batch disable is triggered THEN the system SHALL immediately prevent API access for all selected keys
3. WHEN batch enable is triggered THEN the system SHALL restore API access for all selected keys
4. WHEN status change is applied THEN the system SHALL update isActive field AND log the change with timestamp
5. IF status change fails partially THEN the system SHALL report which keys succeeded/failed AND maintain partial success state

### Requirement 4 - Enhanced Multi-Select Interface

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want an intuitive multi-select interface with persistent selection across search and pagination, so that I can efficiently select keys for batch operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN administrator searches for keys THEN the system SHALL maintain previously selected keys from other search results
2. WHEN navigating between pages THEN the system SHALL preserve selection state across pagination
3. WHEN clearing search THEN the system SHALL maintain all previously selected keys
4. WHEN selection changes THEN the system SHALL update selection counter AND show available batch operations
5. IF administrator leaves the page THEN the system SHALL clear selection state

### Requirement 5 - Batch Operations Dashboard

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want a centralized batch operations interface that shows operation progress and results, so that I can monitor and verify batch changes effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN batch operation is initiated THEN the system SHALL display progress indicator with operation details
2. WHEN operation is in progress THEN the system SHALL show real-time progress AND prevent conflicting operations
3. WHEN operation completes THEN the system SHALL display summary with success/failure counts AND affected key details
4. WHEN operation fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error information AND suggested remediation
5. IF operation is cancelled THEN the system SHALL rollback incomplete changes AND restore previous state

### Requirement 6 - Audit and Logging

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want comprehensive audit logs for all batch operations, so that I can track changes and maintain security compliance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN batch operation is performed THEN the system SHALL log operation details including affected keys, changes made, and administrator identity
2. WHEN operation completes THEN the system SHALL create audit entries for each affected key with before/after states
3. WHEN viewing audit logs THEN the system SHALL provide filtering by operation type, date range, and affected keys
4. WHEN exporting audit data THEN the system SHALL provide CSV/JSON export with complete operation history
5. IF audit logging fails THEN the system SHALL alert administrator AND may prevent operation based on configuration

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Code Architecture and Modularity
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each batch operation component should handle one specific operation type
- **Modular Design**: Batch operations should be implemented as composable services that can be extended
- **Dependency Management**: Minimize coupling between batch operations and existing API key management
- **Clear Interfaces**: Define clean contracts between frontend batch UI and backend batch services

### Performance
- Batch operations SHALL complete within 30 seconds for up to 1000 API keys
- Database operations SHALL use transactions to ensure atomicity
- UI SHALL remain responsive during batch operations with progress feedback
- Memory usage SHALL not exceed 50MB additional allocation during batch operations

### Security
- Batch operations SHALL require administrator authentication and authorization
- All batch changes SHALL be logged with administrator identity and timestamp
- Sensitive data (API keys) SHALL not be exposed in batch operation logs
- Failed operations SHALL not leak information about unauthorized keys

### Reliability
- Batch operations SHALL be atomic - either all changes succeed or none are applied
- System SHALL recover gracefully from partial failures with detailed error reporting
- Database transactions SHALL have appropriate timeouts and rollback mechanisms
- Concurrent batch operations SHALL be prevented through appropriate locking mechanisms

### Usability
- Batch operations interface SHALL provide clear visual feedback on selected items and available operations
- Error messages SHALL be specific and actionable for administrators
- Progress indicators SHALL show percentage completion and estimated time remaining
- Selection state SHALL be intuitive and provide clear visual indication of selected items
